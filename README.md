# node-red-contrib-meraki
A node-red node to communicate with the Meraki cloud!

## Description
This is an initital release of the Node-Red Module for Meraki.

##Considerations
There is no error checking currently so Node may die if you choose something that it does not like. Error checking is coming in the next version.

There is only GET functionality so far.

This release requires at least 6.2 version of Node.

##Install:
npm install node-red-contrib-meraki
